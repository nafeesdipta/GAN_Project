# GAN_Project
Reference: https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-a-generative-adversarial-network-for-a-1-dimensional-function-from-scratch-in-keras/
Update 1:
1D_gan_updated.py: In this project I am trying to develop 3 neural networks with 2 generator and one discriminator. Currently, two generator can
generate points and discriminator can take input from these points and give output. Currenlty, I am working on to update 
Discriminator custom loss function.

Update 2:
gan1.py: This is the script for Analyze Gan's perfomance project. Most ideas has been taken from above mentioned tutorial site but data preprocessing part has been implemented by me.
